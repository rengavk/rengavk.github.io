# Renganayaki Venkatakrishnan - Data Analysis Portfolio

Welcome to my portfolio, I have published works here to showcase my skills in:
- Data visualization and storytelling
- Data modeling and analysis
- Creating interactive, professional dashboards
- Transforming complex data into actionable insights

## üöÄ Projects

### Project one: Aviation ‚Äî Turnaround Delay Root-Cause Miner & Optimizer
*Predict turnaround delays from ground-ops event logs, mine bottlenecks (process mining), and run what-if optimizations to recommend the fastest fix.*

### Project Two: Mental Health ‚Äî Ethical Crisis-Signal NLP (Privacy-first)
*Detect high-risk posts (e.g., CLPsych) with opt-in, privacy filters + calibrated alerts; fairness & harm-reduction focus.*

### Project Three: Supply Chain ‚Äî Multi-Echelon Inventory Simulator
*Compare base-stock vs RL policy; show stockout, holding cost, lead-time risk, and CO‚ÇÇ per km shipped.*

### Project four: Early Warning System for Cardiac Arrest
*This project uses patient vitals (HR, BP, SpO‚ÇÇ, ECG features) to predict the risk of cardiac arrest in the next 6‚Äì24 hours.*
